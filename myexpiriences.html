    <comment>This is a photograph of me and my two cousins, my brother, and my sister. This was taken on Easter, and (if I remember correctly) my parents demanded a good picture before we could hunt for eggs.</comment><br>

    <comment>Here is some of my friends at the 8th grade dance. Or, to be exact, before we went into the dance. After the dance we looked much worse, and much more depressed.<comment><br>
