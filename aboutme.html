    <h2>Me</h2>
    <p>
      I do not see the appeal in describing myself. I mean, I'd try but I'm better and describing almost anything else. Or, rather, I would like much better to describe anything but myself. If I describe myself, I'll probably do it wrong. I would either be too harsh or kind or forgetful and it just wouldn't end well. So, instead I am going to just talk about some stuff that I think is important and hope that that works.

      One thing that I have had on my mind lately and that I think is rather important is what you want to do during your life. Not the what you want to do with your life, but the what you want to do during. Like the fun, bucket-list type stuff. Like a majority, I want to travel. Not only do I want to travel, I want to set food on every continent. Why? Because not only does that sound amazing to do, but it would be a cool story and a fun time. Specifically, I want to eat crepes in their birthplace, fully understand and then see the Aurora Borealias, sleep in a forest tree house, visit a musuem in the UK, and be snowed in(not all in the same place, of course). Also graduate college, but thats a minor detail.
